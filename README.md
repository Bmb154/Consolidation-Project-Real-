# Consolidation-Project-Real-
My late as hell project. 
For goals I had simply wanted a comprehensive video of what I did to let of steam these past few days. Things were going so well and it 
seemd like my life started falling apart, so I wanted to put that into a video. The video will hopefully come across as almost melencholy, 
if I do things correctly...
Proper transitions, keep it short (below 10 minutes) and make it easy to follow.

I may even upload it to youtube if I like it, but who wants to watch that?
